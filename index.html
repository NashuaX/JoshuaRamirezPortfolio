	<h2 style="font-family: georgia, serif; padding-right: 150px;">About Me</h2>
	<p class="right">I was born and raised in San Jose, California and have always been interested in tech related activities.<br>Having been exposed to videogames and computers at a relatively young age, I've always been passio-<br>nate about the ins and outs of both. Currently I am 24 and a student of <strong>SJCC</strong> and <strong>EVC</strong> going through <br>courses to complete my degree in web/interactive design.
	Ideally I'd like to one day work in the gaming <br>industry as I've always been fascinated with videogames.
