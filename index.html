	<h2 style="font-family: georgia, serif;">About Me</h2>
	<p class="right">I was born and raised in San Jose, California and have always been interested in tech related activities.Having been exposed to videogames and computers at a relatively young age, I've always been passionate about the ins and outs of both. Currently I am 23 and a student of <strong>SJCC</strong> and <strong>EVC</strong> going through courses to complete my degree in web/interactive design.
	Ideally I'd like to one day work in the gaming industry as I've always been fascinated with videogames. First I'd like to continue to improve my skillset by taking more classes involving computer tech and graphic design so I can be more versatile.
